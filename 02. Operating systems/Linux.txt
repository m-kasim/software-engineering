Unix / Linux history

1. History
- 1969: Developed by AT&T and Bell Labs
- Peter Neumann coined the name "Unics": Uniplexed Information and Computing Service
- Written in Assembler language
- 1973: Re-written in C

Authors:
Ken Thompson - Also created C language
Dennis Ritchie - Also created C language
Brian Kerninghan
Douglas Mcllroy
Michael Lesk
Joe Ossannas

- C language has been written in Bell Labs in order to ease their work

2. Giants of UNIX:
- 1956: Antitrust settlement forbids AT&T to enter computer business
- 1960s: MIT, AT&T, Bell Labs, General Electric create Multics Time Sharing OS

- 1980: Microsoft creates Xenix
- 1982: System III - First commercial Linux
- 1982: GNU Movement
- 1983: X Window System
- Universities start modification of the UNIX source
- 1987: BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution
- 1982: Sun Microsystems create SunOS from BSD
- 1995: BSD splits to OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD
- 2001-2003: Only SunSolaris, HP-UX, IBM AIX and SGI IRX are active
- OpenBSD is one of the most secure distros
- Bill Gates writes his famous letter "Open Letter to hobbyists" in which he asks them why software should not be paid for?

3. Multics
- The problem was it was only for mainframes and with very bad structure
- Hard for extension with user programs

4. Free Software:
- 1983 - Richard Stallman announces GNU Software Project
- 1989 - GPL license
- 1998 - Open Source initiative
- 1984-1990 - A lot of open source software is created

5. GNU - GNU is Not Unix:
- GNU coreutils: ls, cat, cp, mv, rm ...
- GNU binutils: as, ld, ldconfig
- GNU build system: automake, autoconfig, libtool
- GNU Compiler Collection: gcc
- GNU Debugger: gdb
- GNU C library: glibc
- Bash Unix Shell
- Emacs: Text editor

6. GPL - General Public License:
- The freedom to run the program for any purpose
- The freedom to study how the program works and to change it to do anything
- The freedom to redistribute copies
- The freedom to modify and release your own improved copies

- All adveritising must display the message: This product includes software developed by <Organization>
- Neither the name or the organization or contributors can be used to endorse the product without prior written authorization

8. Linux:
- 1991: Linus Torwards writes Linux as his course work: Linux 0.0.1
- 1994: Linux 1.0
- 1996: Tux mascot. Linux 2.0 works everywhere. The software becomes worldwide
- Linux became popular, because it did not require you to get a BSD/Unix license from an university
  Instead, you could just get Linux and run your programs with it and create your own distro
- 1998: IMB, Compaq, Oracle announce their commercial Linux projects. Unix becomes a thing of the past
- 1999: GNOME started
- 2007: Linux Foundation

9. Distribution:
- Core + User software = Distribution
- Linux Kernel, GNU Libraries, GNU Utilities, X window system
- First distributions: Slackware (closest to BSD and Unix), Debian, RedHat
