Virtualization

1. What is virtualization?
- [virtualization]: Various techniques, methods or approaches of creating a virtual version of something
- hardware/machine virtualization
- OS level/application virtualization
- [Emulation]: Slow process

2. Hardware virtualization
- Creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with its own operating system and applications
- [hypervisor], [VMM (virtual machine manager)]: The software which creates and manages the virtual machine
- [Host OS]: The OS which provides the virtualization software
- [Guest OS]: The "virtual" software
- Virtualization can be done also by a hardware!

3. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure:
- An OS which is somewhere in the cloud, but not in the local computer
- Virtualization is a very competitive market in computing with a lot of vendors

4. Full virtualization:
- Almost complete simulation of the actual hardware to allow software to run unmodified
- The guest OS is not aware it is being virtualized. It requires no modification
- The VM has all hardware components: CPU, HDD, Network card - but they are virtual!!!
- The game emulators (for NES, Play Station) are actually virtual machines!
- It works with [Ring 0]

5. Paravirtualization:
- The guest OS needs to be modified: it talks with "special instructions" to the hypervisor
- All privileged instructions are replaced with calls to the [hypervisor]
- The guest OS is AWARE that it is being virtualized by a [hypervisor]
- The guest OS does not communicate DIRECTLY with the hardware, but with the [hypervisor]
- It is less effective than [full virtualization]
- Microsoft: In order to support Windows on top of Linux, Microsoft has commited about 15 000 lines of code to the Linux kernel,
  making it one of the biggest contributors to the development of Linux kernel
- [Ring -1]: Actually, the guest OS communicates with [Ring -1] and the hypervisor is on this layer

6. KVM virtualization:
- An extra module is added to the kernel
- It actually turns the Linux kernel into a hypervisor
- Memory manager, Scheduler, and others are modified in the process
- KVM is disabled in BIOS by default, because a virus can act as a hypervisor to the OS

7. 4 protection levels:
- [Ring -1]: Virtualiazation support of the newer CPUs
- [Ring 0]: OS Kernel
- [Ring 3]: Applications - virtual address space
- If an application wants to communicate with a kernel module, it needs to call a special API
- Intel/AMD processors support hardware virtualization (Intel VD)
- Hardware assisted virtualization helps to have a guest OS without instructions emulation and translation (they simply extended the)

8. Application level virtualization:
- The application is separated from the other apps
- [Chroot]: changes the root directory ["/"] for an application with a new one
  - Thus you cannot see outside the current root directory

9. Namespace isolation:
- Copying one program from one PC to another (by copying the Heap and the Stack to another machine)
- Isolation of namespace by copying:
  - Network
  - CPU
  - PDI
  - Memory
  - Timezone
  - I/O

10. Example of full virtualization techniques:
- VMWare ESXi
- Hyper-V
- KVM
- XEN - Supports full and paravirtualization
- Paravirtualization
- OS-level / application
- [live migration]: moving the OS image from one hardware host to another
