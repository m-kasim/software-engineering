1. XML:
- Extensive Markup Language, 1996, W3C
- Universal language (notation) for describing structured data using text with tags
- SVG is based on XML
- The data is stored together with metadata abou it
- XML is a standard for creating other languages or data representation
- You can create your own attributes and tags
- XML is strict on formatting
- XML looks like HTML
- RSS is based on XML
- XML is a format for data: Uses tags and attributes
- Developed by W3C
- URI can be URL or URN

2. Structure:
<?xml version="1.0"?>                            // XML header tag (prolog)
<library name=".NET Developer's Library">       // Root document element
  <book>
    <title>Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire</title>
    <author>J. K. Rowling</author>
    <isbn>84213-312312-3123123</isbn>
  </book>
</library

- Only 1 root element
- All tags must be closing
- Order of closing must be correct
- No interval in XML are allowed in tags
- Special parsers are needed to read the XML

3. HTML and XML
- XML is more strict than HTML
- XHTML - all attributes must be closed
- HTML is a language, XML is a standard for creating other languages
- JSON is an alternative to XML and its simpler
- Linux users tend not to use XML

4. Advantages of XML:
- Benefit: It is human-readable
- MS Word document is an XML file
- Allows different systems to intergrate with each other
- It's very useful for documents
- A lot of modern application config files are in XML

5. Disadvantages of XML:
- Data becomes bigger than binary formats => more disk space and network
- But it can be compressed
- DOCX is a compressed XML file
- Decreases performance, because requires a parser
- It's not useful for very big images and video

6. XML namespaces:
- Namespaces allow using different tags with the same name
- Namespace concatenates with the value it is paired with
- It's good for namespaces to have versions

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<sample:towns xmlns:sample="https://towns.com/1.0">
  <sample:town>
    <sample:name>Sofia</sample:name>
    <sample:population>1 000 000<sample:population>
  <sample:town>
<sample:towns>

7. XML schemas
- They define rules and attributes, order and default values
- XML structure is defined by schemas
- Standards:
  DTD - Document Type Definition       - Older, becoming obslete
  XSD - XML Schema Definition Language - New

7.1. DTD:
- Formal language for describing XML structure
- Set of rules for tags and their attributes
- Rarely used nowadays, replaced by XSD

Example - DTD:
<!ELEMENT library (book+)>
<!ATTLIST library name CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT book (title, author, isbn)>
<!ELEMENT title  (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>

7.2. XSD:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

<xs:element name="note">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
</xs:schema>

- VisualStudio has an automatic support and editor for XSD
- XSD must be attached to an XML in order to be validated

8. XML parser:
- [Definition]: programming libraries which make working with XML easier
- Usage:
  - Extract data from XML
  - Modify existing XML
  - Validate by schema
  - Transform from one XML to another (by signing with digital signature)

- Models of work:
  - DOM  (Document Object Model):         Represents XML as tree in memory. Entire XML is loaded at once. Allows XML to be edited. Small documents

  - SAX  (Simple API for XML processing): Reads XML tag by tag. Event-driven API. Allows analyzing of the read portions on each step. XML is loaded piece by piece.
                                          Callbacks (events) are emitted upon reaching a certain tag. Stream access: going back or jumping tags is not allowed.
                                          Less memory use. It requires a state machine to be created. Documents cannot be edited. For large documents

  - StAX (Streaming API for XML):         Like StAX but works in "pull" mode. It's not even driven. Developer manually must code "go to next element"

9. XPath:
- XML Pathing Language
- [Definition]: Language for search/addresing in XML
- XPath expressions contain paths of nodes and filter criteria

Examples:
/library/book[isbn='1-9038380-444']
/catalog/cd[@price < 10.80]
/book/chapter/[3]/paragraph[last()]

10. XSLT - XSL Transformation:
- [Definition]: Transforms one XML document to another XML with a different structure
- XSLT depends on XPath (XPath is used to match parts from the input document and replace them with another XML)
- In particular, XSLT can be used for transforming XML document to XHTML
