Internet

1. History:
- It originated as a concept of wide area networking in science laboratories in US, UK and France
- 1960s: Paul Baran and Donald Davies: [packet switching] - dividing data to packets (originally for a paper for post-Nuclear war communications)
- US Department of Defense awarded contracts for ARPANET during the 1960s
- First message: ARPANET 1969 between Stanford and UCLA
- 1978: TCP/IP - Standard protocol for ARPANET
- 1980s: Swiss and British scientists developer World Wide Web (WWW)
- 1980s: ISPs started to emerge
- ARPANET: Decomissioned in 1990
- 1987-2001: Dotcom Bubble
- 1989: Limited private connections in the cities of USA
- 1995: Commercial restrictions started to be lifted
- 1995: HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
- Web 1.0 - 1990-2000: Wide society adoption
- Web 2.0 - 2000-*: User generated rich content

2. Interfaces:
- Physical interfaces:
  [Ethernet] technologies - RJ45 8P8C Twisted Cable Port
  [Wireless Fidelity] - IEEE 802.11 Standard
- OS have ports for "listening" for connections

3. Services:
- Emails, File transfer, Websites, Video and Audio streaming, Data transfer and others.

2. TCP/IP
- Tranmission Control Protocol
- Complements the IP
- TCP: Keeps track of the segments and the efficient route of the packets and provides the details to the IP
- TCP: When packets are received, it re-assembles them in the correct order
- IP: Handles the actual transport
- One of the main protocols of Internet
- TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications
  running on hosts communicating via an IP network
- Waits for a response before sending the next packet
- TCP also ensures that lost/error packets to be re-sent and notifies the source if it fails again
- Optimized for accurate delivery
- Used by WWW, email services, authentication and etc.
-  Structure:
                IP DATAGRAM
   ___________________________________________________________
   |                 |                                        |
   |    TCP HEADER]  |                  DATA                  |
   |_________________|________________________________________|

3. UDP
- User Datagram Protocol
- which provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
- Does not wait for a response before sending the next packet
- Optimized for fast delivery
- Used by games, media, streaming, video, etc.

3. DNS
- Port: 53
- Translates website names to IP addresses
- DNS database is stored in a zone file, with the following content:
  SOA        - Start of Authority
  AAAA       - IP Address
  MX         - SMTP mail exchange
  NS         - Name servers
  PTR        - Pointer for reverse DNS lookup
  CNAME      - Domain aliases

4. HTTP
- Port: 80
- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Foundation of WWW
- [request]<->[response] protocol for [client]<->[server] communication
- [client]: browser    (Firefox, Chrome, etc...): Asks for resources at address
- [server]: web server (Apache, nGINX, gUnicorn): Provides response with HTML or other resources
- Structured text with links between documents
- Web cache: In order to improve response time
- URL: Resources are located via Uniform Resource Locatiors
- URI: Uniform Resource Identifier schemes. URL is simply a URI that happens to point to a resource over a network
- Application layer 7 protocol

5. HTTPS:
- Port: 443
- HTTP over TLS
- HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communications
- Encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security), formerly SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
- Better privacy and integrity, prevents "man-in-the-middle" attacks
- Initially it was used only for payments and sensitive data, now it is adopted as a general standard

6. WWW
- WWW an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
  interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.
- Resources displayed via WWW are often Web pages, which are text-structured HTML ecoded documents

7. DHCP
- Port: 67, 68
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protoocol
- DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses to the hosts
- It allows hosts to automatically resquests IP addresses from the ISP, eliminating the need of Network Administrator
- APIPA address: Not able to communicate outside the current network

9. IMAP
- Port: 143
- Internet Message Access Protocol: GET EMAIL
- Used by email clients to retrieve email from mail servers using TCP/IP
- Mail is left on the server, until the user deletes them

10. IMAPS
- Port: 993
- IMAP over SSL

10. POP3
- Port: 110
- Post Office Protocol: GET EMAIL
- It has been largely replaced by IMAP
- Default behavior: DOWNLOAD and DELETE
- Can be encrypted with TLS: Port: 995

11. SSH
- Port: 22
- Secure Shell Protocol
- secure transfer over unsecure network
- Remote login, remote file transfer
- client-server
- Replacement for Telnet
- Edward Snowden's files indicate the NSA is able to decrypt SSH sessions

12. TelNet
- Port: 23
- Virtual terminal connection
- It is unencrypted and has security risks

13. SMTP
- Port: 25
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol: SEND EMAIL
15. TLS/SSL

16. FTP
- Port: 21
- File Transfer Protocol
- client-server model
- command line interface
- authentication: cleartext or anonymous

17. SFTP
- FTP over SSH
