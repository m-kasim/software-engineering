UML

1. UML
- Using inheritance, we can create class hierarchies
- Classes are represented by rectangles, containing their fields and methods
- Relations between classes are shown in arros
- Closed triangle arrow = inheritance
- Other arrows          = some kind of association
- [!] Assosiation: to instantiate an object inside a class, which already has inherited that object

2. Notations:

<< interface >> Animal  // Interface
            + Add()     // public method
            - Remove    // private method
            # Edit      // protected method

- - - - - - |>          // Implements from

------------|>          // Inherits from

------------->          // Association between classes
