Project Management

1. Software development models:
- Waterfall
- Rapid Application Development
- Evolutionary process model: Incremental and Iterative
- Prototype model
- Spiral model

2. Criteria for differentiation
- by feedback
- by time
- by used methods

- [How to choose]: Choosing a model is based on the organization and the nature of the application/project

3. Waterfall
- Process phases follow one after another and the order can't be changed
- The client is hardly able to introduce any changes

4. Rapid Application Development:
- Short cycles
- "Fast speed" adaptation to Waterfall
- There are multiple teams, together with [code reuse], [component reuse] and merges between teams
- Several teams work parallelly
- Parallel modeling:  Business modeling, Data modelling, Process modelling
- Construction
- Integration

- Shortcomings:
  - Difficult when the project cannot be divided into modules
  - Considerable human resource needed
  - Difficult with new and cutting-edge technologies

5. Incremental development:
- The system is not delivered as a whole
- It is delivered piece by piece, by merging components

6. Iterative development:
- The system is delivered from the beginning
- The components are merged together and then they are being gradually improved

7. Prototype models
7.1. Evolutionary: It aims to deliver a system, starting from a prototype. It delivers a system.
7.2. Throw-away:   It aims to make the requirements clearer, by throwing away some of the prototypes down the road. It delivers a prototype + specification

8. Spiral model:
- It combines waterfall and prototype model
- It's iterative: Each cycle begins with risk analysis includes more and more sophisticated activities and finishes with a milestone
- It has multiple [anchor point milestones]

9. Formal transformation model:
- Based on transforming the specification to system based on formal mathematical transformations
